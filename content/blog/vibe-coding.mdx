A while ago, I tweeted:

> “I think I just discovered a whole new vibe coding hack 😭🔥”

It wasn’t some breakthrough model.  
It wasn’t a secret AI tool.  
And it definitely wasn’t a 10x productivity extension.

It was something much simpler.

And much more uncomfortable.

It was about how I was thinking while building.

## The Seduction of Vibe Coding

If you’ve built anything with AI in the past year, you know the feeling.

You open your editor.  
You describe what you want.  
The model responds instantly.  
You paste it in.  
It works.

You feel unstoppable.

You add another feature.  
Another.  
Another.

At some point, you stop “designing” and start reacting.

The AI suggests the direction.  
You follow.

And that’s when things start breaking in quiet ways.

The variable names drift.  
The architecture becomes fuzzy.  
Logic exists, but it doesn’t feel intentional.  
You hesitate before touching older parts of your own code.

It still works.

But it doesn’t feel solid.

## The Moment I Realised Something Was Off

I was building a relatively simple system — nothing crazy.

But halfway through, I realised something strange:

I wasn’t thinking ahead anymore.

I was thinking one prompt at a time.

Each interaction was locally correct.  
Globally messy.

The model wasn’t the problem.

The way I was using it was.

I had unconsciously turned engineering into a sequence of micro-requests.

And I had removed structure from the process.

---

## The Shift That Changed Everything

The “hack” was embarrassingly simple.

Before asking for code, I started asking for structure.

Not:

“Write the implementation.”

But:

“How should this be structured?”

What modules should exist?  
What responsibilities belong where?  
What are the possible failure points?  
What edge cases am I ignoring?  

And only after that:

“Now implement this specific part.”

It sounds obvious.

It felt revolutionary.

## Why This Worked So Well

LLMs are exceptional at abstraction.

They are surprisingly good at decomposing systems, identifying components, and suggesting architecture patterns.

But when you immediately ask them to generate full implementations, they optimise for completion — not coherence.

When you slow the process down and force a structural conversation first, something shifts.

The solution space becomes smaller.  
The direction becomes clearer.  
The hallucination surface reduces dramatically.

You move from:

“Generate something that works.”

to

“Help me design something that lasts.”

## The Real Problem with Most AI Workflows

We treat AI like a faster Stack Overflow.

Ask.  
Copy.  
Paste.  
Move on.

But production systems are not built from isolated answers.

They are built from decisions.

And decisions require context.

When you skip the decision layer and jump straight to implementation, you’re outsourcing thinking without realising it.

The code still runs.

But you don’t fully own it.

## The Psychological Difference

There’s a subtle but powerful mental shift here.

Earlier, my interaction with AI sounded like:

“Build this for me.”

Now it sounds like:

“Think this through with me.”

The difference is enormous.

When you collaborate on structure first, you stay in control.

You guide the constraints.  
You define the boundaries.  
You choose the tradeoffs.

The AI becomes an amplifier.

Not a driver.

## When Pure Vibe Coding Is Still Useful

I’m not against vibe coding.

For prototypes? It’s incredible.  
For UI exploration? Perfect.  
For boilerplate? Amazing.

But for anything that needs to scale — APIs, agents, data pipelines, stateful systems — improvisation becomes technical debt disguised as speed.

That was the illusion I had fallen for.

Fast felt productive.

Until it wasn’t.

## What This Taught Me About Building with AI

The biggest insight wasn’t technical.

It was behavioral.

AI rewards clarity.

The clearer your structure, constraints, and intent, the better the output.

When you treat it like a code vending machine, you get scattered solutions.

When you treat it like a thinking partner, you get systems.

And that’s when building starts to feel less chaotic and more deliberate.

## The Real “Hack”

The tweet made it sound dramatic.

It wasn’t.

The hack was this:

> Ask for thinking before asking for typing.

That’s it.

The moment I started structuring before generating, my systems became cleaner, debugging became easier, and refactoring stopped being scary.

Vibe coding didn’t disappear.

It evolved.

And somewhere between chaos and control, building with AI finally started feeling like engineering again.
