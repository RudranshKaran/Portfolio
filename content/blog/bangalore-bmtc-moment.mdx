A few days ago, while heading back to college from home on a BMTC bus, I witnessed something small.

Nothing dramatic.  
No accident.  
No big confrontation.

Just one of those ordinary city moments that quietly say more than they should.

It was around 10:30 in the morning.  
Peak Bangalore traffic.  
The bus moved in slow, reluctant bursts — stop, inch forward, stop again.

A few seats ahead of me, there was a man — maybe in his early thirties.  
Laptop open. Earphones plugged in.  
He was on an office call.

You could tell he was trying hard to sound professional.

“Yes, yes, I’ll send it in five minutes.”  
“No, that won’t be an issue.”  
“Let’s close it today.”

All of this while the bus engine roared, auto drivers honked, and the city did what it always does — rush.

Then suddenly, chaos.

The bus driver started yelling at a truck driver.  
Apparently, the truck had grazed the bus’s side mirror.

Both of them stood in the middle of the road, shouting.  
Passengers leaned forward, mildly entertained.  
Some even smiled. Free drama.

But that man with the laptop didn’t smile.

He looked irritated.  
Not at the drivers. Not at the accident.

At the delay.

He kept muttering under his breath,  
“Don’t waste time… just go.”

Every extra minute seemed to physically bother him.

The bus finally moved.

A few kilometres later, it stopped again.  
The driver wanted to inspect the mirror properly.

Thirty seconds. Maybe less.

The man sighed loudly this time.  
Closed his eyes.  
Shook his head.

He wasn’t angry.

He was exhausted.

And that’s when it hit me.

## What Are We Really Rushing Towards?

I didn’t know what to feel.

Should I admire his dedication?

Here was someone so committed that even a moving bus became an office desk.

Or should I feel uneasy about the system that made him this restless?

He wasn’t lazy.  
He wasn’t careless.  
He was trying to survive a rhythm that doesn’t slow down.

In Bangalore, ambition moves faster than traffic.

Rent is high.  
Deadlines are tighter.  
Competition is relentless.

And somewhere in that mix, slowing down starts to feel like failure.

## The Invisible Pressure

The traffic in Bangalore is infamous.

But what struck me that morning wasn’t the vehicles.

It was the tension.

The need to be available.  
The pressure to respond instantly.  
The fear of appearing unproductive.

That man wasn’t frustrated because of the mirror.

He was frustrated because every minute felt expensive.

A 30-second stop wasn’t just a delay.

It was risk.

Risk of missing a point in the meeting.  
Risk of sounding unprepared.  
Risk of falling behind.

And when you live in a city that runs on opportunity and comparison, falling behind feels terrifying.

## When Work Follows You Everywhere

There’s something strangely symbolic about attending an office call from a public bus.

A moving office.  
Noisy. Unpredictable. Temporary.

It’s almost poetic.

We’ve blurred the line so much between life and work that even traffic becomes a productivity obstacle.

Even chaos must be managed.

Even interruptions must be minimised.

There’s no neutral space anymore.

## The Realisation

As the bus continued crawling forward, I kept thinking about him.

About how many of us are exactly like that.

On calls during commutes.  
Replying to messages at red lights.  
Feeling uneasy when nothing is “happening.”

We’ve internalised urgency.

And that’s when the thought came to me:

> The traffic isn’t just on Bangalore roads.
> It’s in our heads too.

We carry it with us.

The constant mental rush.  
The invisible clock ticking.  
The pressure to optimise every minute.

## A Quiet Question

I’m not judging him.

I might be him someday.

Maybe I already am, in smaller ways.

But that morning made me pause.

If a 30-second stop feels unbearable,  
what does that say about the pace we’ve accepted as normal?

Are we building ambition?

Or are we building anxiety?

## The Mirror That Wasn’t Just a Mirror

It’s funny how the whole incident started because of a side mirror.

A small object.

A small pause.

Yet it revealed something much bigger.

Not about traffic.

Not about drivers.

But about how tightly wound we’ve become.

That day, the bus moved again.

The city continued.

Calls were probably completed.

Deadlines were probably met.

But that image stayed with me.

A man on a laptop.  
In a noisy bus.  
Frustrated at thirty lost seconds.

And a quiet reminder that sometimes,  
the road isn’t the only thing that needs decongesting.
