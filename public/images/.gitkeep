# Placeholder Images

This directory should contain:

1. **hero-rudransh.jpg** - Your professional photo (recommended: 1200x1200px)
2. **project-rag.jpg** - RAG Pipeline project image (1200x675px)
3. **project-agents.jpg** - AI Agents project image (1200x675px)
4. **project-backend.jpg** - Backend project image (1200x675px)

## Temporary Placeholder URLs

Until you add your own images, you can use these placeholder services:

- Unsplash: https://source.unsplash.com/1200x1200/?professional,portrait
- Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/1200/1200

Or create solid color placeholders with:
- https://via.placeholder.com/1200x1200/0F172A/3B82F6?text=Rudransh+Karan

## Quick Fix

To avoid 404 errors, you can either:
1. Add real images to this folder
2. Update image paths in the code to use external URLs
3. Use a fallback image in the Image component

The app will work fine with missing images, but you'll see broken image icons until you add them.
